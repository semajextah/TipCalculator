This is a simple tip calculator
https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/tip-calculator.php

I did not include the "divide by" function because I think it is largely useless.
I was a server for 10 years, 99% of restaurants will happily split a ticket...
Instead I decided to include popular tipping percentiles, 10% , 15%, 20% with the added
functionality of declaring a custom tip percentage.
